        <h1>What is One Piece About?</h1>
        <p>
          One Piece focuses on the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, a joyful young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit, 
          who goes on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the greatest treasure known as the One Piece, 
          left behind by the deceased King of Pirates, Gol D. Roger.

          Zoro, Luffy's right-hand man, faces off against King, Kaido's right-hand man.

          marking an epic face-off between the second-in-commands of two powerful captains.

          After Luffy's friend is shot by a Celestial Dragon, one of the highest social classes in the world, 
          Luffy approaches the Dragon and punches him right in the face! 
          This is unheard of, as Celestial Dragons are usually feared and obeyed without question.
